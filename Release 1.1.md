Remember to always back up your save files.

Creation Club support coming soon, as well as an optional profile to disable some of the NPC replacers. No guarantees, though.

## CHANGED

* Set the following in Fallout4Prefs.ini **WARNING: CAN IMPACT FPS.** "bScreenSpaceReflections=1"
* Updated the See-Through-Scopes patches to include the RobCo Recon Scope Replacer.
* Updated the mod list name in Mod Organizer. It no longer says 'Magnum Opus', and instead properly reflects the fact that we're a fork of the list with our own name.
* Updated PraVisifier & Valhalla Edits to properly give things tags/resolve a few conflicts/etc. Like always, let me know of any inconsistencies in my naming.

*Please report any bugs to me. Thank you :)*
